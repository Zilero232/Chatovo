# External documentation

Where the docs for our dependencies come from, and when reading them is mandatory.

**Nothing is vendored into this repo.** Third-party docs are fetched live through the **context7 MCP server**, which serves version-current pages. A copy checked into `docs/` would drift from the installed version within weeks and would be worse than no copy at all.

## How to fetch

Two calls, always in this order:

1. `resolve-library-id` — the library name plus what you are trying to do, returns a `/org/project` id.
2. `query-docs` — that id plus **one concept per call**. Split unrelated questions into separate calls.

The table below already carries the resolved ids, so step 1 can be skipped for anything listed here.

Ids for anything not listed: resolve it, then add the row here.

## When fetching is mandatory

Read the docs **before writing the code**, not after a failure, whenever the task involves:

- **A LiveKit API beyond the hooks we already use** — track publication options, device switching, `RoomOptions`, `setVolume` and its source argument, ICE and reconnection behaviour, egress, data channels, participant permissions. This SDK changes fast and its types under-document the runtime.
- **better-auth configuration** — session lifetime, hooks (`databaseHook`, `onError`), plugins, token transport, cookie versus Bearer, the Prisma adapter's schema expectations.
- **A Next.js file convention or an async API** — `params`/`searchParams`, metadata, route handlers, caching, the RSC boundary. Version 16 differs from every tutorial written for 13-15.
- **A react-query behaviour that is not `useQuery(key, fn)`** — retry semantics, `gcTime` versus `staleTime`, invalidation, optimistic updates, the query and mutation caches.
- **A Prisma migration or a schema-level feature** — relation modes, multi-file schema, `db push` versus `migrate`, generator options. Repo specifics live in [guides/migrations.md](guides/migrations.md).
- **A Base UI primitive** — its parts, the render prop, portal and positioner behaviour, controlled state. Repo gotchas are in [apps/client/CLAUDE.md](../apps/client/CLAUDE.md).
- **A helper that might already exist** in remeda / ts-pattern / date-fns / reactuse — see "Reuse over reinvention" in the root [CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md). Checking the docs is cheaper than a hand-rolled helper that has to be reviewed and tested.

Skip fetching only for a mechanical edit inside code whose API is already visible in the file being edited.

## Precedence

Repo documents outrank library documents. When an external page suggests a pattern our own docs forbid — a `cn()` wrapper, `useState`-driven forms, a manual `fetch` — our rule wins. The library docs answer *how the API behaves*, never *how this project is written*.

Internal documents: [architecture/](architecture/) for how a subsystem works, [guides/style.md](guides/style.md) for code style, [architecture/fsd.md](architecture/fsd.md) for layer rules, [rustore/](rustore/) for the store release.
