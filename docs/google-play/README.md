# Google Play — Chatovo

Checklist and copy-paste material for publishing the Android app `chatovo.app`
to Google Play.

Play is the only store the app ships to. The desktop installers on GitHub
Releases are unrelated to it.

## ABIs

Both the CI job and `bun android:build` build `aarch64` and `x86_64` only.

32-bit Rust output (`armeabi-v7a`, `x86`) links its `LOAD` segments at a 4 KB
alignment, which Play flags: devices with 16 KB memory pages — Pixel 9 and
newer — may fail to install or crash. The 64-bit targets already come out at
`0x4000`, so dropping the 32-bit ones clears the warning and halves the bundle.
Play has required 64-bit support since 2019, and `x86` only ever served
emulators.

Check a built library with:

```bash
llvm-readelf -l <lib>.so | grep -A1 LOAD   # want 0x4000, not 0x1000
```

## Commands

```bash
# One-time: Android Studio + SDK/NDK, rust android targets
bun android:init

# Dev on a device/emulator
bun android:dev

# Release build (APK + AAB)
bun android:build
# Output: apps/tauri/gen/android/app/build/outputs/bundle/universalRelease/app-universal-release.aab
```

## CI (GitHub Actions)

| Workflow | Trigger | Contents |
|----------|---------|----------|
| `release.yml` | push a `v*` tag | `vX.Y.Z` — desktop installers (Windows, macOS arm64 + x64, Linux) and the signed Android AAB |
| `deploy.yml` | manual run | Web client + API images to GHCR, then the VPS stack (no GitHub Release) |

Job `android` builds and signs the bundle and attaches it to the draft release.
Uploading it to Play is a manual step in the Play Console: the first release has
to be created by hand anyway, and automating it later needs a Google Cloud
service account with the Play Developer API enabled.

## Environment

`apps/tauri/.env` (copy of `.env.example`) — read by every `android:*` script:

```env
JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Android\Android Studio\jbr
ANDROID_HOME=C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk
NDK_HOME=C:\Users\<you>\AppData\Local\Android\Sdk\ndk\<version>
```

Install the NDK from Android Studio → SDK Manager, then point `NDK_HOME` at the
folder under `ndk\`.

Required SDK Tools (SDK Manager → SDK Tools tab):

- **Android SDK Command-line Tools (latest)** — without it `tauri android init` fails
- NDK (Side by side)
- Android SDK Build-Tools
- Android SDK Platform-Tools
- At least one Android SDK Platform (API 34+)

Verify after install:

```bat
dir "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk\cmdline-tools\latest\bin\sdkmanager.bat"
dir "%LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk\ndk"
```

```bash
rustup target add aarch64-linux-android armv7-linux-androideabi i686-linux-android x86_64-linux-android
```

## Backgrounded calls

There is no foreground service, so a call goes silent once the app is
backgrounded: since Android 11 the system revokes microphone access from a
process with no `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE` service. Verified against the
merged manifests — no dependency contributes one either, not `tauri-plugin-fcm`,
not the WebRTC path.

Play does not reject over it, but it breaks the app's main flow, so it is worth
fixing before a wide release.

Fixing it needs all three, together:

1. A Kotlin foreground service with `foregroundServiceType="microphone"`, plus a
   persistent notification, started when a room is joined and stopped on leave.
2. `FOREGROUND_SERVICE` and `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_MICROPHONE` in the manifest —
   `build.rs` already injects permissions this way. Do **not** add them ahead of
   the service: Play asks for a declaration justifying every foreground service
   permission, and one that nothing uses invites a rejection.
3. A Play Console declaration for the `microphone` foreground service type.

Tauri has no API for this — `gen/android/` is regenerated on every build, so the
service has to come from a Tauri plugin (Rust wrapper, Kotlin service, JS
bridge) rather than a hand-edited file or an overlay script.

## In-app updates

There are none on Android, by design. Play forbids an app updating itself around
the store, so the Tauri updater is excluded from Android at three layers: the
dependency is behind `cfg(not(android))` in `Cargo.toml`, the plugin is
registered under `#[cfg(desktop)]` in `lib.rs`, and `updater:default` only
appears in `capabilities/desktop.json`. The client hook is gated on
`isTauriDesktop()` on top of that.

Play updates the app itself. If a forced-update screen is ever wanted, the
supported route is Play's own `AppUpdateManager` (`com.google.android.play:app-update`),
which would need a Tauri plugin wrapping it — nothing like that exists today.

## Push notifications

Push runs on Firebase Cloud Messaging, which is the native transport for a Play
build: every device that can install from Play has Google services.

### Firebase Console

1. Create a Firebase project (or reuse an existing one).
2. Add an Android app with the package `chatovo.app`.
3. Download `google-services.json`.
4. Project settings → Service accounts → Generate new private key → keep the JSON for the server.

### Android app

`gen/android/` is gitignored and regenerated by `tauri android init`. Do **not**
edit it by hand.

1. Download `google-services.json` from the Firebase Console (Android app `chatovo.app`).
2. Save it to **`apps/tauri/android/google-services.json`** (committed — not a secret).
3. Run any android script — `setup-android-fcm.mjs` copies the file into `gen/android/app/` and patches Gradle.

`POST_NOTIFICATIONS` is injected through `build.rs` on every build. Plugin
permission: `fcm:default` in `capabilities/mobile.json`.

### Server

Set `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` in the root `.env` to the service account JSON on
a single line. Push is skipped when the user holds an open realtime WebSocket.

## Before the first submission

1. Google Play developer account registered and identity-verified ($25, one-off)
2. App `Chatovo` created with the package `chatovo.app` — **the package name is permanent once published**
3. Play App Signing enrolled and the upload key registered — see [signing.md](signing.md)
4. Privacy policy URL filled in: `https://chatovo.ru/privacy`
5. Data safety form completed from [data-safety.md](data-safety.md)
6. Account deletion URL filled in: `https://chatovo.ru/account/delete`
7. Support mailbox `zilero@chatovo.ru` reachable
8. Reviewer credentials filled into the Play Console's *App access* section — **not** committed to this repo
9. At least one account holding the `admin` role — promote the first one in the database, the rest from the Users tab: [moderation.md](moderation.md)
10. Database migrated: `bun db:deploy` from `apps/server/`

## Package identifiers

| Platform | Identifier |
|----------|------------|
| Desktop | `chatovo.desktop` |
| Android | `chatovo.app` |

## Version code

Tauri derives it from the root `package.json` version:
`major * 1000000 + minor * 1000 + patch`. Version `1.4.3` → `versionCode = 1004003`.

Play rejects an upload whose `versionCode` is not strictly higher than any
previous one — including one that was uploaded and then discarded. A botched
upload therefore costs a patch bump.

Override it in the config when that is not enough:

```json
"bundle": { "android": { "versionCode": 1004003 } }
```
