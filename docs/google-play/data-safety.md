# Personal data

What Chatovo collects, why, and who it is shared with. Fill the Play Console's
Data safety form from this, and answer a reviewer from it.

No permission is requested at startup without a user action.

## Sharing with third parties

| Recipient | What is shared | Why |
|-----------|----------------|-----|
| LiveKit (self-hosted SFU) | Voice, video, data channels | Real-time media relay |
| SMTP provider | Email address | Address verification, password reset |
| Firebase Cloud Messaging (Google) | Push token, notification title | Push delivery on Android |
| Google Play | Install and update events | App distribution |

Nothing is shared with ad networks or third-party analytics: the app carries no
advertising.

## Retention

| Data | Retained for |
|------|--------------|
| Account and profile | While the account is active |
| Messages and attachments | Until deleted by the user or with the account |
| Session logs | A limited period needed for security |
| Voice and video | Not stored — relayed only |

## Deletion

Self-service, from Settings → Security → Delete account, or from
`https://chatovo.ru/account/delete`. better-auth emails a confirmation link;
following it deletes the account.

Removed: the profile, the avatar files on disk, the rooms the user created,
friendships, and push devices. Messages in shared rooms are kept with a null
sender, so other people's conversations stay readable — the author's name is
gone from them. Backups roll over within 30 days.

|-------------|--------|
| Advertising | No |
| In-app purchases | No |
| User-generated content | Yes — chat, profiles, voice |
