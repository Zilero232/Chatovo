# Feature-Sliced Design — Chatovo

The FSD methodology as applied to `apps/client/`. This document is the working reference for the frontend architecture: layer hierarchy, import rules, public APIs, segments.

Full specification: [feature-sliced.design](https://feature-sliced.design). Linter for FSD rules: [Steiger](https://github.com/feature-sliced/steiger).

> **Deviations from FSD canon in this project** (deliberate, reasons below):
>
> | FSD canon | Chatovo | Why |
> |---|---|---|
> | Root `src/` | Root `apps/client/` (no `src/`) | Monorepo: `apps/client` already isolates the frontend. `@/` → `apps/client/`. |
> | Layer `pages/` | Layer `views/` | `pages/` at the Next.js root enables the Pages Router. `views/` sidesteps it. |
>
> Everywhere below where the canon says `pages` or `src/pages`, we have `views`. Where it says `src/`, we have the `apps/client/` root.

## 1. Layer hierarchy (top to bottom)

| # | Layer | Purpose | Slices? |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | App | Routing, providers, global styles, entrypoint | No |
| 2 | Views *(canon: Pages)* | Whole screens / route-level compositions | Yes |
| 3 | Widgets | Large self-contained UI blocks (reusable or independent) | Yes |
| 4 | Features | User interactions with business value (forms, actions) | Yes |
| 5 | Entities | Core business concepts (user, room, message) | Yes |
| 6 | Shared | UI kit, API client, utilities, i18n, config — project-agnostic | No |

The `Processes` layer is deprecated — its contents move into `Features` or `App`.

> **Domain grouping of slices.** In Chatovo the slices inside `features/`, `entities/` and `widgets/` are grouped by business domain (`auth`, `room`, `app`, `layout`). This is a layer on top of the FSD canon (`<layer>/<slice>/`). Imports: `@/features/auth/sign-in`, `@/entities/room/room`, `@/widgets/layout/authed-shell`. The `app` group is cross-domain application infrastructure (release, locale, tray, shortcuts, update). The `layout` group is the root shell.

---

## 2. The golden rule: import direction

```
App → Views → Widgets → Features → Entities → Shared
```

A module imports only from layers **strictly below** it. Banned:

- **Upwards** — a Feature cannot import from a Widget or a View.
- **Sideways within a layer** — one Feature cannot import another Feature.

**Exception — cross-entity references.** When Entity A needs a type from Entity B, use the `@x` pattern: `entities/A/@x/B.ts` exports only what B needs from A.

---

## 3. Slices

A slice is a directory inside a layer, named after a **business domain** (not a technical role).

- ✓ Good: `user`, `room`, `auth`, `message`, `notification`
- ✗ Bad: `components`, `hooks`, `helpers`, `utils`

**Rules:**

- Every slice is isolated — zero coupling with neighbouring slices of the same layer.
- Related slices may be grouped into subfolders, but they stay independent.
- Slice names are kebab-case.

**Domain groups (Chatovo):** the `features/`, `entities/` and `widgets/` layers group slices by business domain:

- `auth/` — authentication (sign-in, sign-up, user)
- `room/` — rooms, voice, chat, presence
- `social/` — friends, profiles, social dialogs
- `app/` — application infrastructure (release, locale, system-tray, shortcuts, check-app-update)
- `chat/` (widgets only) — the chat panel
- `layout/` (widgets only) — the root shell

A domain folder is an organisational container, **not a public API**. Always import down to the slice level: `@/features/room/create`, not `@/features/room`.

---

## 4. Segments

Segments organise code inside a slice by technical purpose:

| Segment | Holds |
|---|---|
| `ui/` | Components, formatters, styles |
| `model/` | Types, interfaces, stores, schemas, business logic |
| `api/` | Backend requests, data mappers, query hooks |
| `lib/` | Internal utilities for this slice only |
| `config/` | Feature flags, constants, configuration |

Custom segments are allowed — name them after **what they do**, not what they are.
✗ Bad: `hooks/`, `components/`. ✓ Good: `model/`, `lib/`.

---

## 5. Public API (`index.ts`)

Every slice has an `index.ts` at its root, re-exporting the public interface.

```ts
// features/room/room-control/index.ts
export { RoomControlBar } from './ui/RoomControlBar';
export { useRoomControls } from './model/hooks';
export { DeafenProvider } from './model/contexts';
```

**Rules:**

- **No wildcard exports** — `export * from './ui/Foo'` is banned. Be explicit.
- **Minimal surface** — export only what other layers actually need.
- **External imports go through the slice index only** — never `@/features/auth/sign-in/ui/SignInForm` directly. Always `@/features/auth/sign-in`.
- **A domain group is not a public API** — `@/features/auth` does not exist; import the specific slice. The domain folder only organises files.
- **`model/` — barrels in the subfolders, not at the `model/` level.** `model/hooks/index.ts`, `model/contexts/index.ts`, `model/stores/index.ts` — each subfolder gets its own barrel. Do NOT create a slice-level `model/index.ts`. The slice `index.ts` and internal imports go through the subfolder: `./model/hooks`, `../model/contexts`. More in [`docs/guides/style.md`](../guides/style.md) §11.
- **No circular imports** — do not import from a slice's own `index.ts` inside that slice. Inside, use relative paths.
- **`ui-kit/` is the design system, a separate layer next to `shared/`.** Segments: `primitives/` (base), `components/` (composed), `icons/`, `styles/`. **Every component gets its own PascalCase folder** (`primitives/Button/`, `components/FormField/`, …) with `Component.tsx`, `Component.module.scss`, optionally `Component.types.ts` and a mandatory `index.ts` barrel. The segment barrels (`primitives/index.ts`, …) and the root `ui-kit/index.ts` re-export everything. From outside, only `@/ui-kit`, never `@/ui-kit/primitives/Button`. Headless primitives come from **`@base-ui/react`**; styles are **SCSS modules**, tokens live in `app/globals.scss` + `ui-kit/styles/_tokens.scss`. More in [`docs/guides/style.md`](../guides/style.md) §2.1.

## 6. Next.js integration (App Router)

`app/` stays at the `apps/client/` root. Route files are thin wrappers that delegate into `views/`:

```tsx
// app/(authed)/room/page.tsx — server, thin
import { RoomPage } from '@/views/room';

const Page = () => <RoomPage />;

export default Page;
```

Route files (`page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`) are server components, without `'use client'`. They contain only metadata, a wrapper and a default export. All UI and logic lives in `views/<name>/`.

> FSD canon recommends `export { Page as default } from '@/views/...'` and an empty `pages/` with a `.gitkeep`. In Chatovo the layer is named `views/`, so there is no clash with the Next.js Pages Router and no `.gitkeep` placeholder is needed. The route wrapper is written as an ordinary component (see above).

### Path aliases

`@/` points at `apps/client/` (canon: at `src/`):

```jsonc
// tsconfig.json
{ "compilerOptions": { "paths": { "@/*": ["./*"] } } }
```

## 7. Composition patterns

**View** *(canon: Page)*:

```
View
├── imports Widget A (self-contained block)
├── imports Widget B
├── imports Feature X (interactive element)
└── uses Shared UI primitives for layout
```

**Widget:**

```
Widget
├── imports Feature(s) for interactivity
├── imports Entity types/components for display
└── uses Shared UI primitives
```

**Feature:**

```
Feature
├── imports Entity types/hooks for domain data
└── uses the Shared API client, UI primitives, utilities
```

## 8. Checklist (check before every change)

- [ ] The file is in the correct layer directory
- [ ] Imports go downwards only — never up or sideways
- [ ] The slice has a public `index.ts` with explicit named exports
- [ ] No direct imports into a slice's internals from outside
- [ ] Directory and file names are kebab-case (exception — component folders: PascalCase)
- [ ] Component functions are named PascalCase exports (no default exports from slices)
- [ ] Segments describe purpose (`model/`, `api/`), not technical role (`hooks/`, `components/`)
- [ ] Route files are thin wrappers that delegate into `views/`
- [ ] The Shared layer holds no business logic — project-agnostic code only
- [ ] The Entities layer holds no interaction UI logic — that is the Features level

> **Naming in Chatovo:** FSD canon requires kebab-case for every file. The Chatovo code style (see [`docs/guides/style.md`](../guides/style.md) §5) uses kebab-case for slices and segments, **PascalCase for component folders and files** (`VoiceRoom/VoiceRoom.tsx`), and camelCase for hooks and utilities. This is a local convention on top of FSD.

## 9. Common mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---|---|
| A Feature imports from another Feature | Move the shared logic into Entities or Shared |
| A View holds business logic directly | Move it into a Feature, compose it in the View |
| `shared/hooks/useSignIn.ts` | Auth is a business domain → `features/auth/sign-in/model/use-sign-in.ts` |
| A Widget imports from a View | Invert it: the View imports the Widget |
| A slice exports everything via `export *` | Explicit named re-exports |
| A `components/` folder at the layer root | Classify it: is it a Widget, a Feature, an Entity or Shared UI? |
| A route file holds the full page implementation | Move it into `views/<name>/`, leave the route a thin wrapper |
