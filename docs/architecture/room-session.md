# Room session — the call outlives navigation

An active call is not tied to the `/room` route. The user can open the lobby, the admin panel or settings and the LiveKit connection stays up, collapsed into a compact bar. Only two things end it: the leave button and a page reload.

## How it used to work

`LiveKitRoom` lived inside `RoomPage`, which is to say inside `AuthedShell`'s `children`. Any `router.push` unmounted the page, LiveKit tore the connection down and fired `onDisconnected`. That handler cannot tell "the user pressed Leave" from "the component unmounted", so it called `onLeave` and redirected to the lobby. Opening settings was enough to drop out of a call.

## How it works now

The session sits above the route.

```text
AuthedProviders
└── RoomSessionProvider          entities/room/session — { session, open, close }
    └── AuthedShell
        └── .content
            ├── .page  {children}          ← the routed page
            └── RoomSessionHost            ← LiveKitRoom lives here
```

- **`entities/room/session`** holds the active session: `{ roomId, roomName, token, isDm, isInvisible }`. A plain React context, not TanStack Query — this is not server state, it has no key and no fetcher.
- **`widgets/room/room-session-host`** is the only place `LiveKitRoom` is mounted. It sits next to `{children}` in `AuthedShell`, so a route change never touches it.
- **`views/room`** no longer owns the connection. `useRoomPage` fetches the token and calls `open(...)`; the page then renders `null`, because the host draws the room.

Expanded or collapsed is decided by `pathname === ROUTES.room`. The `isMinimized` prop on `VoiceRoom` swaps only the visual layer — `LiveKitRoom`, the microphone, deafen state and the chat panel are left untouched.

## What this changes for the code

- `onLeave` now genuinely means leaving. It arrives from `room.disconnect()`, called by the control bar, the tray menu or the collapsed bar.
- "The active room" is no longer derived from the URL. `useActiveVoiceRoomId` lives in `entities/room/session` and reads the session instead of `searchParams`.
- The token is fetched once: `useRoomToken` is disabled while a session for that room is already open.
- Toggling invisible mode still recreates the connection — the `` `${roomId}:${isInvisible}` `` key on `VoiceRoom` is deliberate, the server has to issue a new token.

## Boundaries

- The session lives only in the tab's memory. A reload loses it, which is intended: LiveKit tokens are short-lived, and silently rejoining a call without the user asking would surprise more than it helps.
- The provider sits inside `AuthedProviders`, so signing out unmounts it along with the rest of the tree and the connection closes with it.
